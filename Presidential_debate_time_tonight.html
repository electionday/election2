        <p>Nov. 3, 2024. Former President <b>Donald</b> J. <b>Trump</b>, in the closing days of the 2024 election, continues to be a font of exaggerations, misleading claims and outright lies.

In his final days in office, <b>Trump</b> became the first president ever to be impeached twice &ndash; the second time for inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol during the certification of the election he lost &ndash; and the nation&rsquo;s first chief executive in more than 150 years to refuse to attend his successor&rsquo;s inauguration.
