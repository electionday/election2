        <h2><strong>Presidential election polls 1980 Current election results party wise</strong></h2>
        <p>PolitiFact is live fact-checking the first 2024 <b>presidential</b> <b>debate</b> Sept. 10 in Philadelphia between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.  The debate featured a simulcast of CNN&rsquo;s <b>Presidential</b> <b>Debate</b> with periodic pauses after Trump and Biden&rsquo;s statements for Kennedy to answer. Before the debate began, FiveThirtyEight conducted a poll on voters&rsquo; views of the candidates and issues.  Kamala Harris baited Donald Trump for nearly all of the 1 hour and 45 minutes of their first and potentially only <b>debate</b> on Tuesday night &ndash; and Trump took every bit of it. The vice president had...  Have fun,&rdquo; the former Republican president responded. The exchange set the tone for the 90-minute <b>debate</b> to come: Harris controlled the conversation at times, baiting Trump with jabs at his economic policy, his refusal to concede his 2020 election loss and even his performance at his rallies.  Moments after the <b>debate</b> ended, singer-songwriter Taylor Swift said on Instagram that she would be voting for Harris. Here&rsquo;s how the candidates&rsquo; answers stood up to the facts.  Did former <b>President</b> Donald Trump come off as a messiah or a maniac? And yes, the visuals in this first <b>presidential</b> <b>debate</b> of the cycle were phenomenally important.  Kamala Harris and Donald Trump clashed in their first <b>presidential</b> <b>debate</b> Tuesday in Philadelphia, less than two months before Election Day. Heading into the <b>debate</b>, Harris appeared to have...  Follow CNN&rsquo;s analysis as former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris face off for the first time in ABC&rsquo;s <b>presidential</b> <b>debate</b>.  Tuesday&rsquo;s <b>debate</b> between the current vice president and former <b>president</b> was a clear contrast from the June <b>debate</b> that forced <b>President</b> Biden from the race. </p>        <p><a href="https://electionday.github.io/election2/245.html">Trump live right now</a>.
