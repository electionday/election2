        <h2><strong>What was trump policies Trump georgia governor</strong></h2>
        <p>When it comes to the format of <b>presidential</b> debates, majorities of registered voters strongly or somewhat favor limiting answers to a fixed time and muting microphones to prevent interruptions &mdash; two rules that will be in place for the upcoming CNN debate.  t. e. The 2020 United States <b>presidential</b> debates were a series of debates held during the 2020 <b>presidential</b> election.

The Commission on <b>Presidential</b> Debates modified the <b>format</b> of this <b>debate</b> stating that it would be held &quot;virtually&quot; because of concerns about public health due to President Trump&#39;s COVID-19 diagnosis.  A vice <b>presidential</b> <b>debate</b>, which was sponsored by CBS, was held on October 1. Four general election debates sponsored by the Commission on <b>Presidential</b> Debates (CPD) were originally scheduled to be held between September 16 and October 9, 2024. Both Biden and Trump opposed the CPD&#39;s <b>debate</b> <b>format</b> and schedule.
