        <p>What began as a campaign town hall in the Philadelphia suburbs quickly turned into an impromptu <b>dance</b> party Monday night after Donald <b>Trump</b> was twice interrupted by medical emergencies in the...  Donald <b>Trump</b> has brought some of his signature <b>dance</b> moves to his latest <b>rally</b> in Pennsylvania where he received a huge applause from the crowd in the battleground state.  <b>Donald</b> <b>Trump</b> stopped answering questions and bobbed his head to music for 30 minutes during a recent town hall.  A town hall event for Donald <b>Trump</b> in Pennsylvania took a turn after the former president ended the event by playing his music playlist and dancing in front of the crowd.  At his Monday town hall event in Oaks, Pennsylvania, he quit taking questions from the crowd, and turned his campaign <b>rally</b> into a <b>dance</b> party. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not do any more questions,&rdquo; <b>Trump</b> said.  What followed was more than 30 minutes of <b>Trump</b> swaying on stage and occasionally doing his well-known two-handed <b>dance</b> to some of his favorite tunes, chatting with the event&#39;s host, South...  Mr. <b>Trump</b> had his staff fire up his campaign playlist, standing on the stage for about half an hour and swaying to songs as his crowd slowly dwindled.  <b>Trump</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> town hall in Oaks, PA, essentially cut short by two people passing out bc of heat so Trump asked his team to play some of his favorite songs while he stood on stage and listened.  Donald <b>Trump</b> spent almost an entire Philadelphia town hall event <b>dancing</b> and listening to music instead of answering questions. </p>        <p>What did fox news say about the presidential debate.
