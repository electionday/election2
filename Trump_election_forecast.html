        <h2><strong>Trump election forecast Trump impeachment prosecutors</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Trump</b> accused Biden of allowing millions of unauthorized migrants to enter the country. He also said many falsehoods about the current state of immigration. Analysis  Former President Donald <b>Trump</b> doubled down on his border policies, while Vice President Kamala Harris discussed her background in <b>immigration</b> affairs. Concern over the nation&rsquo;s border featured heavily in the <b>debate</b> between the 2024 presidential candidates.  <b>Immigration</b> remains a signature issue for <b>Trump</b>. He blames previous administrations for failing to secure the southern border, and in his first term, he advocated for sharply reducing both...  <b>Immigration</b> was a big topic at Tuesday night&#39;s presidential <b>debate</b> in Philadelphia. We fact-check former President Donald <b>Trump</b> and Vice President Kamala Harris on their claims.  Asked how he plans to deport more than 11 million undocumented immigrants during the presidential <b>debate</b> Tuesday, former President <b>Trump</b> slammed the Biden-Harris administration claiming their...  <b>Trump</b> has seized on immigration as an issue that could win him back the White House, repeating <b>anti</b>-<b>immigrant</b> rhetoric and criticizing Harris &mdash; whom he refers to as the &ldquo;border czar&rdquo; &mdash; on ...  <b>Trump</b> attacked Harris and Biden&#39;s records on <b>immigration</b>, arguing that they&#39;re failing to stem people from other countries from entering the U.S. and causing violence.  <b>Trump</b>&rsquo;s claims that these policies lead to increased crime by undocumented immigrants are central to the larger <b>debate</b> over whether the sanctuary movement threatens the safety of the local communities embracing it. Research shows that there is no link between sanctuary policies and rising crime rates.  Harris has said <b>Trump</b> worsened the situation at the border by killing a bipartisan Senate compromise earlier this year that would have included toughening asylum standards and hiring more border agents, <b>immigration</b> judges and asylum officers. </p>        <p>Prediction of election results.
