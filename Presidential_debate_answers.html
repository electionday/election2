        <h2><strong>Presidential debate answers Election results connecticut 2024</strong></h2>
        <p>No Evidence. Is &quot;<b>unburdened</b> by what has been,&quot; part of a phrase often used by Vice President <b>Kamala</b> <b>Harris</b>, drawn from a quote by philosopher Karl Marx? No, that&#39;s not true: There is no evidence that Marx publicly made such a statement in his lifetime. <b>Harris</b> has not credited Marx with the phrase.  To the extent that it reflected a media pathology, it wasn&rsquo;t complicity in the lie of the night, but a wider tendency to chase shiny objects and the unknown&mdash;and it&rsquo;s this tendency, not any specific format, that can make coverage feel, to quote an infamous <b>Harrisism</b>, unburdened by what has been.  <b>What</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Be</b>, <b>Unburdened</b> <b>By</b> What <b>Has</b> <b>Been</b> is a catchphrase of Vice President Kamala Harris that she has used in speeches throughout her career. In late June 2024, a supercut of Harris using the phrase went viral online, leading to its ironic and sincere embrace by meme makers.  Vice President <b>Kamala</b> <b>Harris</b> dropped one of her word-salad catchphrases during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh, Pa. &mdash; despite facing widespread mockery over the meme-worthy soundbite.  Memes featuring <b>Harris</b> laughing and delivering her infamous and often-repeated quotes are going viral again &mdash; among them a four-minute supercut of her saying her favorite <b>line</b>: &ldquo;What can be ...  <b>Kamala</b> <b>Harris</b>&rsquo; frequent saying, &ldquo;What can be, <b>unburdened</b> by what has been,&rdquo; was borrowed from Karl Marx. Rating: Unproven. About this rating.  The RNC compiled a supercut of Harris being &quot;<b>unburdened</b>&quot; and shared it on social media, arguing that it shows she is &ldquo;unoriginal, annoying, and highly incompetent.&rdquo;  Sky News host James Morrow has critiqued <b>Kamala</b> <b>Harris</b> for repetitive rhetoric, pointing out her frequent use of the phrase: &quot;<b>unburdened</b> by what has been&quot;.  While the coconut tree meme was one single throwaway comment from <b>Harris</b>, the &quot;<b>unburdened</b>&quot; meme was born out of the fact the vice president has recycled this specific line countless times. </p>        <p><em>Presidential debate answers</em>.
