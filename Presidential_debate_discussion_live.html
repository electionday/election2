        <h2><strong>Presidential debate discussion live Us election polls in swing states 2024</strong></h2>
        <p>1960 <b>Electoral</b> College <b>Results</b>. Byrd received electoral <b>votes</b> for President from Alabama (6), Mississippi (8) and Oklahoma (1). Thurmond received electoral votes for Vice President from Alabama (6) and Mississippi (8). Goldwater received 1 electoral vote for Vice President from Oklahoma.  In Illinois, the most recent and fair-minded study (Kallina&rsquo;s <b>Kennedy</b> v. Nixon) concludes that sufficient evidence does not exist to determine whether Chicago&rsquo;s Democratic machine stole more ...  <b>Kennedy</b> won 49.7 percent of the popular vote to <b>Nixon</b>&rsquo;s 49.5 percent. <b>Kennedy</b> captured only 112,827 more votes than <b>Nixon</b> out of more than 68 million votes cast. The Electoral College...  Eisenhower&#39;s Vice President, Richard <b>Nixon</b>, who had transformed his office into a national political base, was the Republican candidate, whereas the Democrats nominated Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy. The electoral vote was the closest in any presidential election since 1916.  John F. <b>Kennedy</b> won the popular vote by a slim margin of approximately 100,000 votes. Richard <b>Nixon</b> won more individual states than <b>Kennedy</b>, but it was <b>Kennedy</b> who prevailed by winning key states with many electoral votes. To mollify these concerns, <b>Kennedy</b> addressed a group of Protestant ministers.  <b>Kennedy</b> defeated <b>Nixon</b> when votes were finally counted in the Electoral College, by a margin of 303 to 219. But in the popular vote, <b>Kennedy</b> won by just 112,000 votes out of 68 million cast, or a margin on 0.2 percent.  Kennedy won <b>49.7</b> <b>percent</b> of the popular vote to Nixon&rsquo;s 49.5 percent. Out of more than 68 million votes cast, Kennedy captured only 112,827 more votes than Nixon.  Due to the result of a state primary, five of the Democratic electors on the general <b>election</b> ballot were loyalists pledged to <b>Kennedy</b> and the remaining six were Free electors, not pledged to the Democratic national ticket.  United States presidential <b>election</b> of 1960, American presidential election held on November 8, 1960, in which Democrat John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican Vice Pres. Richard M. Nixon. Kennedy thus became the first Roman Catholic and the youngest person ever elected president. </p>        <p>2024 election results by state csv. Register to vote here sign.
