        <p>Election Day is the day legally established to select public officials in the United States. General elections for federal offices&mdash;President, Vice President, and U.S. Congress&mdash;are held on the Tuesday after the <b>first</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> November in even-numbered years. Citizens vote for President  <b>The</b> <b>Elections</b> Clause gives the states and the federal government concurrent jurisdiction over congressional elections, granting states the power to set the &ldquo;Times, Places, and Manner&rdquo; of these elections, and delegating to Congress the authority to &ldquo;alter&rdquo; state regulations or &ldquo;make&rdquo; its own.  The Supreme Court has interpreted the <b>Elections</b> Clause expansively, enabling states to provide a complete code for congressional <b>elections</b>, not only as to times and places, but in relation to notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and ...  Often known as the &quot;<b>Elections</b> Clause,&quot; Article I, Section 4, Clause 1 of the Constitution outlines the powers given to Congress and the states regarding elections.

Under the <b>Elections</b> Clause, each state establishes how it will hold congressional <b>elections</b>, subject to Congress adopting or altering the ...  In short, the appointment and mode of appointment of electors belong exclusively to the states under the <b>Constitution</b> of the United States. The National Popular Vote plan unifies the states&rsquo; clear powers under Article II, Section 1 with their power to form interstate compacts with Congressional consent under Article I, Section 10.  The <b>Elections</b> Clause. The <b>Elections</b> Clause in Article I, Section 4, Clause 1 of the <b>U.S</b>. <b>Constitution</b> establishes a framework for <b>elections</b>, delegating initial authority to state legislatures while granting Congress the power to adjust these rules.
