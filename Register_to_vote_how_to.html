        <p>In an extract from his new book about the Trump White House, reporter Michael Wolff reveals that Ivanka <b>Trump</b> regularly describes the mechanics of her father&rsquo;s hairstyle.  The 70-year-old Republican&#39;s 2016 presidential campaign took a toll on his hairstyle. Many noticed his duck-tale-shaped hairstyle as he shook hands with supporters and kissed babies on the campaign trail. In the photo above, <b>Trump</b>&#39;s <b>haircut</b> had a curled back and crazy side wings that looked amateurish.  Below, see some of the most hair-<b>raising</b> things he&#39;s had to say about his strand style. Donald Trump <b>in</b> 2008.

Instead of the swoop of thin golden straw he&#39;s sported for what feels like forever, <b>Trump</b> walked on stage and removed a white &quot;USA&quot; baseball cap from his head to reveal a new slicked-back...  Ever since he first shot to fame as a business mogul in the 1980s, <b>Donald Trump </b>has embraced the boujee lifestyle. From his big hair to his eternal tan, <b>Trump </b>is the epitome of brash new-money swag. But for all his bourgeois posturing, <b>Trump </b>is, truth be told, hardly famed for being fashionable.  The subject of Donald <b>Trump</b>&#39;s hair &mdash; the, uh, unique hairstyle and how it comes together &mdash; was the subject of the now infamous book about the White House, Michael Wolff&#39;s Fire and Fury.
